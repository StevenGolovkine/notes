# Locally connected

A topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is said to be locally connected at a point $a \in X$ if each neighborhood $N$ of $a$ contains a connected neighborhood $U$ of $a$. 

The space is said to be locally connected if it is locally connected at each of its points.

A topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is said to be locally connected at a point $a \in X$ if and only if there is basis for the neighborhoods at $a$ composed of connected subsets of $X$.

# Intervals of the real line

Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the real line. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$.

The set $A$ is an interval if $A$ contains at least two distinct points, and if given points $a, b \in A$ with $a < b$, then for each point $x$ such that $a < x < b$, it follows that $x \in A$.

A closed interval is noted $[a, b]$ and an open interval is noted $(a, b)$.

Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a < b$.
The subset of $\mathbb{R}$ consisting of all real numbers $x$ 
- such that $a < x$ is denoted by $(a, +\infty)$.
- such that $a \leq x$ is denoted by $[a, +\infty)$.
- such that $x < a$ is denoted by $(-\infty, a)$.
- such that $x \leq a$ is denoted by $(-\infty, a]$.
- such that $a < x \leq b$ is denoted by $(a, b]$.
- such that $a \leq x < b$ is denoted by $[a, b)$.
The set $\mathbb{R}$ can also be written $(-\infty, +\infty)$.

The set $A$ is an interval if and only if it is one of the previously defined form.

The set $A$, that contains at least two distinct points is connected ([[20240131085434_connectedness]]) if and only if it is an interval.

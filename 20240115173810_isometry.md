# Isometry

Two metric spaces $(A, d_A)$ and $(B, d_B)$ are isometric (or metrically equivalent) if there are inverse functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that
$$\forall x, y \in A, d_B(f(x), f(y)) = d_A(x, y) \quad\text{and}\quad \forall u, v \in B, d_A(f(u), f(v)) = d_B(u, v).$$
Note that the functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous.

A necessary and sufficient condition for these metric spaces to be isometric is that there exists a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ such that:
1. $f$ is one-one
2. $f$ is onto
3. $\forall x, y \in A, d_B(f(x), f(y)) = d_A(x, y)$.

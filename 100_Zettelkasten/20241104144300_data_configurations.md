# Data configurations for differential equations

## Initial configuration

We know the state of the system at time $t_0$ and want to predict the behavior at time $t > t_0$. The initial value may by random.

## Boundary configuration

Something is known about the system at terminal time $t_1$. For example, we know the first and last value of a Brownian bridge.

## Distributed configuration

We have measurements that are distributed over the complete range of observation. The number of points needed to detect a peak is the *resolution* of the data.

## Unobersed variables

Some variables are not observed or only sporadically observed. Sometimes parameters can not be estimated in that case.

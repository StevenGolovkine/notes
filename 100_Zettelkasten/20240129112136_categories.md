# Categories

A category $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of objects $A$. Members of $\mathcal{C}$ are called the objects of the category. For each ordered pair $(X, Y)$ of objects of the category, a set $H(X, Y)$ called the maps of $X$ into $Y$ together with a rule of composition which associates to each $f \in H(X, Y)$ and $g \in H(Y, Z)$, a map $gf \in H(X, Z)$.

* The composition is associative: if $f \in H(X, Y), g \in H(Y, Z)$ and $h \in H(Z, W)$ then $h(gf) = (hg)f \in H(X, W)$.
* Identities exist: for each object $X \in A$, there is an element $1_X \in H(X, X)$ such that for all $G \in H(X, Y), g1_X = g$ and for all $h \in H(W, X), 1_Xh = h$.

Examples:
- Category $\mathcal{C}_S$ of sets and functions. Let $A_S$ be the class of all sets and note $H(X, Y), X, Y \in A_S$, the set of all functions from $X$ to $Y$. For $X \in A_S$, $1_X$ is the identity mapping of $X$ onto itself.
- Category $\mathcal{C}_M$ of all metric spaces and continuous functions.
- Category $\mathcal{C}_T$ of all topological spaces and continuous mappings.

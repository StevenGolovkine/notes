__Contents__: State vectors are used to describe the state of the qubits. Adding and multiplying by a constant state vectors are the same operations as for usual vectors.

For example, for two qubits, the basis elements are written:
$$\left|00 \right> = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \left|01 \right> = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \left|10 \right> = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \left|11 \right> = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Every vectors that have two qubits can be written as:
$$\left|\psi \right> = a_{00}\left|00 \right> + a_{01}\left|01 \right> + a_{10}\left|10 \right> + a_{11}\left|11 \right>.$$
Another popular basis is a $45$ degree rotation of the previous basis. For one qubit,
$$\left|+ \right> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, \left|- \right> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Note that it is always assumed that $\sum_{i=1}^N a_i^2 = 1$ to define state vectors (becaise the $a_i^2$ are probabilities). And we can not assess the phase directly, we have only access to the phase differences. Actually, no experiment can distinguish between $\left| a \right>$ and $\left| -a \right>$. We say that these state vectors are different mathematically but not physically. 

State vectors are the basis of quantum operation ([[20230426110222_quantum_operations]]). It exists two types of state vectors: the product state ([[20230503095342_product_state]]) and the entangled state ([[20230503095408_entangled_state]]). The difference between the two is that product states can be written as the product of the qubits while this is not the case for the entangled state.

# Limits

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $a_1, a_2, \dots$ a sequence of points in $X$. We say that the point $a \in X$ is the limit of the sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots$ if $\lim_{n} d(a, a_n) = 0$. In that sense, the sequence converges to $a$ and we note $\lim_n a_n = 0$.

**Characterization using neighborhood**:
We note $V_a$ a neighborhood of the point $a$.
$$\lim_n a_n = a \Leftrightarrow \forall V_a, \exists N \in \mathbb{N} / a_n \in V_a, n > N.$$
(As the set of points that may not be in the neighborhood of $a$ is finite, and the number of values that $n$ can take is not, we say that the sequence converges to $a$ if for neighborhood of $a$, almost all the points of the sequence are in this neighborhood.)

__Contents__: Qubits are an extension of bits to quantum mechanics. Qubits are bits that follows the rules of quantum physics instead of classical physics. Note that, bits are used to represent any piece of information with $0$ and $1$. With $n$ bits, we can write $2^n$ numbers.

For now, quantum computing is limited. The number of qubits is limited and noise lead to large error rate.

We represent quantum algorithms in a schematic level of bits using circuit diagrams. Gates are building blocks of circuit diagrams:
* X-gate = NOT gate (flips the bit value)
* CNOT-gate = XOR gate (figure out if two bits are differents)
* Toffoli-gate = CCNOT gate (inverse a bit if two others are $1$)
* Hadamard-gate = H-gate (probabilistic operation on input bits). Note that two consecutive H-gate leads to a deterministic output.

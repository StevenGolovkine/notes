# Homeomorphism

Two topological spaces $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and $(Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ are homeomorphic there are inverse functions $f: X \rightarrow Y$ and $g: Y \rightarrow X$ such that $f$ and $g$ are continuous.

A necessary and sufficient condition for these topological spaces to be homeomorphic is that there exists a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ such that:
1. $f$ is one-one;
2. $f$ is onto;
3. A subset $O$ of $X$ is open if and only if $f(O)$ is open.

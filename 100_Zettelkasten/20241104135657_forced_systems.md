# Forced systems

Forced systems are dynamical systems with input variables such as force $F$. The term *buffer* to describe how a dynamical system spreads its reponse over a longer time interval than that over which the input changes. General notation: $Dx = f(x | \theta, u)$ where $u$ is the vector of external forces.

Example of Newton's second law:
$$D^2 x = F / M$$

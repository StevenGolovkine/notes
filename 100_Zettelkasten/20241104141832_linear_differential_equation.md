# Linear differential equations

The linearity in differential equations refers of the linearity of the function $f$ with respect to its arguments $x$ and its derivatives.

Example of order $m$ buffer:
$$D^m x = \sum_{j = 0}^{m - 1}\beta_j D^j x$$
The coefficients $\beta_j$ may vary over $t$ but must not depend on $x$. When all the coefficients are constants, the system is *stationary*.

# [[20230523084929_qubits_encoding]] - Qubits encoding
__Tags__: #quantum

__Contents__: There are mainly two way to encode a qubit.

The normal way using $\lvert 0 \rangle$ or $\lvert 1 \rangle$ and performing a z-measurement.
The rotating way using $\lvert + \rangle$ or $\lvert - \rangle$ and performing a x-measurement.

We can define the expectated value of a z-measurement by the difference between the probability of measuring $0$ and the probability of measuring $1$:
$$\langle Z \rangle = p_z(0) - p_z(1).$$
In a similar way, we define the expected value of a x-measurement by:
$$\langle X \rangle = p_x(0) - p_x(1).$$
If the results are certain, we have that $\langle Z \rangle^2 = 1$ (or $\langle X \rangle^2 = 1$). If the results are random, we have that $\langle Z \rangle^2 = 0$ (or $\langle X \rangle^2 = 0$). Moreover, for any valid state, $\langle Z \rangle^2 + \langle X \rangle^2 \leq 1$.
The restrictions that apply to classical variables do not always concerned qubits.

__Contents__: Neural networks can be used to solve population balance equations for non-inertial particles dynamics. The probability density function is used to describe the evolution of particles parameters. Using a combination of Artificial Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network (with one LSTM layer), the size and composition distributions in the flamme is predicted. Here, the PDF is estimated using neural networks. It reduces computation times.

__Contents__: In the classical settings, knowing things about something allows to know something about something correlated. This is refered as classical correlation. However, for qubits, results of a measurement are not known before the measurements are made. Depending on the kind of measurements, different correlations can occur.

Measurements:
- Just measuring -> z-measurement
- Rotation of the qubit (applying h-gate) + measurement -> x-measurement

| Qubits      | Type | Results|
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| $\lvert 0 \rangle$      | z-meas       | 0 |
| $\lvert 0 \rangle$   | x-meas        | 0 or 1 |
| $\lvert 1 \rangle$   | z-meas        | 1 |
| $\lvert 1 \rangle$   | x-meas        | 0 or 1 |
| $\lvert + \rangle$   | z-meas        | 0 or 1 |
| $\lvert + \rangle$   | x-meas        | 0 |
| $\lvert - \rangle$   | z-meas        | 0 or 1 |
| $\lvert - \rangle$   | x-meas        | 1 |

If the rotation is different from $\pi / 2$, both measurements are random, but the probability to be in every state is not equal. These results are from the uncertainty principle ([[20230523084444_uncertainty_principle]]), if you are certain of a x-measurement, you can't be certain of the z-measurement and vice-versa.

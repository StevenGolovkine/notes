# Closure

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space. Let $A$ be a subset of this topological space. The closure of $A$, noted $\bar{A}$, is the set of points $x \in X$, such that for each neighborhood $N$ of $x$, $N \cap A \neq \emptyset$.

Given a closet set $F$ containing $A$, $\bar{A} \subset F$.
Given a point $x \notin \bar{A}$, then $x \notin F$ for some closed set $F$ containing $A$.

Note $\{F_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$ the family of all closed sets containing $A$, then
$$\bar{A} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} F_{\alpha}.$$

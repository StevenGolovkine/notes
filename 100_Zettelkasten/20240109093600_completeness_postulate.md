# Completeness postulate

A non-empty set $A$ of real numbers that has an upper bound, necessarily has a least upper bound. Similarly, if $A$ has a lower bound, it has a greatest lower bound (using the complement of the set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}$).

The l.u.b. and g.l.b. may or may not be an element of $A$.

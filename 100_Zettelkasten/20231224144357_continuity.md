# Continuity

Let $f$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$, two general spaces. We say that $f$ is continuous at some point $x \in X$ if $f(x)$ is close to $f(y)$ whenever $x$ is close to $y$. 
The idea to define how close the points should be is that, no matter the choice of closeness between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$, we can find a point $y$ that close to $x$ such that $f(x)$ is close to $f(y)$. We say that a function $f$ is continuous if for every point in $X$, the function is continous.

Definition: Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, d^\prime)$ be two metric spaces. Let $x \in X$. A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 / \forall y \in X, d(x, y) < \delta \Longrightarrow  d^\prime(f(x), f(y)) < \epsilon.$$ Note that in this definition, the choice of $\delta$, with respect to $\varepsilon$, may depend on the considered point $x$.

Examples of continuous functions:
- Constance function, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(x) = a, a \in \mathbb{R}$.
- Identity function, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(x) = x$.

Property:
- The composition of two continuous functions is a continuous function.

**Continuity can also be characterized using open balls ([[20231231114443_open_balls]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if and only if
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, f(\mathcal{B(x, \delta)}) \subset \mathcal{B}(f(x), \varepsilon).$$

This can be rewrite using the inverse of $f$:
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if and only if
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \mathcal{B(x, \delta)} \subset f^{-1}(\mathcal{B}(f(x), \varepsilon)).$$

**Continuity can also be characterized using neighborhood ([[20240103153715_neighborhood]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if and only if, for each neighborhood $M$ of $f(x)$, there is a corresponding neighborhood $N$ of $x$, such that $f(N) \subset M$ (or equivalently $f^{-1}(M) \subset N$).

This can be rewrite using only the inverse image of $M$ (because a set that contains a neighborhood of $x$ is also a neighborhood of $x$):
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if and only if, for each neighborhood $M$ of $f(x)$, $f^{-1}(M)$ is a neighborhood of $x$.

**Continuity can also be characterized using limits ([[20240109085857_limits]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if and only if, whenever $\lim_n x_n = x$ for a sequence $x_1, x_2, \dots$ of points of $X$, $\lim_n f(x_n) = f(x)$.

**Continuity can also be characterized using open/closed sets ([[20240111174343_open_closed_sets]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if for each open subset $O$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(O)$ is an open subset of $X$.

A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if for each closed subset $O$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(O)$ is a closed subset of $X$.

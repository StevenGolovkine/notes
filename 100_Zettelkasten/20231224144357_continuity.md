# Continuity

Let $f$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$, two general spaces. We say that $f$ is continuous at some point $x \in X$ if $f(x)$ is close to $f(y)$ whenever $x$ is close to $y$. 
The idea to define how close the points should be is that, no matter the choice of closeness between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$, we can find a point $y$ that close to $x$ such that $f(x)$ is close to $f(y)$. We say that a function $f$ is continuous if for every point in $X$, the function is continous.

Definition: Let $(X, d)$ and $(Y, d^\prime)$ be two metric spaces. Let $x \in X$. A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 / \forall y \in X, d(x, y) < \delta \Longrightarrow  d^\prime(f(x), f(y)) < \epsilon.$$ Note that in this definition, the choice of $\delta$, with respect to $\varepsilon$, may depend on the considered point $x$.

Examples of continuous functions:
- Constance function, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(x) = a, a \in \mathbb{R}$.
- Identity function, $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(x) = x$.

Property:
- The composition of two continuous functions is a continuous function.

Continuity can also be characterized using open ball and neighborhood ([[20231231114443_open_balls]]):
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous at the point $x \in X$ if
$$\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, f(\mathcal{B(x, \delta)}) \subset \mathcal{B}(f(x), \varepsilon).$$

# B-splines

B-splines are local functions, each of them covering a small part of the $x$-axis.

B-splines consist of polynomial segments, each of a pre-specify degree $d$, that begin and end at specific values, called knots.
The number of B-splines in the basis is equal to the number of sections defined by the knots plus the degree of the polynomials. At any given point of the $x$-axis, the number of evaluations that have a nonzero value is equal to $d + 1$.

**Characterization of a B-spline basis**: use the number of segments on the chosen domain.
ðŸ›‘  The number of segments is independent of the degree of the B-splines and can be chosen freely.

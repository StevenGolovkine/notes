# Interior

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space. Let $A$ be a subset of this topological space. A point $x$ is said to be in the interior of $A$ if $A$ is a neighborhood of $x$. The interior of $A$ is denoted by $\text{Int}(A)$. It is the largest open set contained in $A$.

Given an open set $O$ contained in $A$, $O \subset \text{Int}(A)$.
Given a point $x \in \text{Int}(A)$, then $x \in O$ for some open set $O \subset A$.

Note $\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}$ the family of all open sets contained in $A$, then
$$\text{Int}(A) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} O_{\alpha}.$$

# [[20230306092016_aggregation]] - Aggregation of particles

__Tags__: #aggregation

---
__Contents__: The aggregation of particles refers to the process of putting together two or more particles to form one bigger particle. This process is also named coagulation. During this process, the number of particles decreases while the total mass remains.

Examples of model:
* Pure aggregation model with constant aggregation coefficient
* Pure aggregation model with linear aggregation coefficient
* Pure aggregation model with linear aggregation coefficient and particle removal rate
* Pure aggregation model with constant aggregation coefficient and linear growth rate

# Homomorphism

A homomorphism $f$ from a group $(G, \times_1)$ to a group $(H, \times_2)$ is a function $f: G \rightarrow H$ such that:
- $f(e_1) = e_2$ if $e_1$ and $e_2$ are identities in $G$ and $H$ respectively.
- For all $g, g^\prime \in G$, $f(g \times_1 g^\prime) = f(g) \times_2 f(g^\prime)$.

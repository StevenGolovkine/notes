__Contents__: Iterables are objects that we can iterate over it, e.g, lists.

Iterables are classes based on three principles:
* Implement the iterable protocol: the `__iter__()` method returns an iterator that is usually not `self`.
* Make the `iter()` method return an iterator and is used to make an iterable an iterator.
* Implement the sequence protocol: sequences are data types that store items in consecutive orders. Its syntax is `yield from <iterable>`.

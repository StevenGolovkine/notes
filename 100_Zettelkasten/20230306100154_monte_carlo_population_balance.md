# [[20230306100154_monte_carlo_population_balance]] - Monte-Carlo methods for population balance models

__Tags__: #numerical-methods 

---
__Contents__: Monte-Carlo (MC) method is a numerical method based on simulation. In the context of population balance models, this method can be used to reconstructed the distribution of the size of the particles. The aim is to formulate a simulation that produces a distribution identical to the solution of the equation of population balances. It builds upon that elementary events are discrete and probabilistics.

**Questions**:
* Can we build confidence intervals from MC simulations?
* In a Bayesian perspective, can we build credibility intervals from MC simulations?

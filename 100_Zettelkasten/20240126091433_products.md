# Products of topological spaces

Let $(X_1, \mathfrak{S}_1), \dots, (X_n, \mathfrak{S}_n)$ be topological spaces. The topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$, where $\mathfrak{S}$ is the collection of subsets of $X$ that are unions of sets of the form $O_1 \times \cdots \times O_n$, each $O_i$ being an open subset of $X_i$, is called the product of the topological spaces $(X_i, \mathfrak{S}_i), i = 1, \cdots, n$. We note $X = \prod_{i = 1}^n X_i$.

**Characterization of neighborhoods:**
A subset $N$ of $X$ is a neighborhood of a point $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in N$ if and only if $N$ contains a subset of the form $N_1 \times \cdots \times N_n$, where each $N_i$ is a neighborhood of $a_i$.

Consider the $i$th projection $p_i: X \rightarrow X_i$. If $O_i \in \mathfrak{S}_i$, then
$$p_i^{-1}(O_i) = X_1 \times \dots \times X_{i - 1} \times O_i \times X_{i +i} \times \dots \times X_n.$$
Since this set is an open subset of $X$, the projection maps are continuous. A subset $O_1 \times \dots \times O_n$ of $X$ can be written as $p_1^{-1}(O_1) \cap \dots \cap p_n^{-1}(O_n)$.

Let $\{(X_\alpha, \mathfrak{S}_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces. The topological product of this family is the set $X = \prod_{\alpha \in A} X_\alpha$ with the topology $\mathfrak{S}$ consisting of all unions of sets of the form $p_{\alpha_1}^{-1}(O_{\alpha_1}) \cap \dots \cap p_{\alpha_n}^{-1}(O_{\alpha_n})$, where $O_{\alpha_i} \in \mathfrak{S}_{\alpha_i}, i = 1, \dots, n$.

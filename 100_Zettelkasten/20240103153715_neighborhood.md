# Neighborhood

A neighborhood $V$ of a point $x \in X$ is a set of points in $X$ that contains $x$ where we can move some amount of that point (defined as an open ball) without leaving the set $V$.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $x \in X$. Let $V \subset X$. The set $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ if $\exists \delta > 0, \mathcal{B}(x, \delta) \subset V$. In particular, $\mathcal{B}(x, \delta)$ is a neighborhood of $x$.

The collection of all neighborhoods of a point $x \in X$ is called a **complete system of neighborhood** and is denoted by $\mathfrak{N}_x$. A collection $\mathfrak{B}_x$ of neighborhood of $x$ is a **basis for the neighborhood system** at $x$ if every neighborhood $V$ of $x$ contains some element $W$ of $\mathfrak{B}_x$.

Open balls are neighborhoods of each of their points.

**Some properties:** Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.
- For all $x \in X$, there exists at least one neighborhood of $x$. (For example, the set $X$.)
- For all $x \in X$ and for all neighborhood $V$ of $x$, $x \in V$. (By definition.)
- For all $x \in X$, if $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and $V \subset W$, then $W$ is a neighborhood of $x$. ($W$ contains the same open balls about $x$ than $V$.)
- For all $x \in X$ and for all pair $V, W$ of neighborhoods of $x$, $V \cap W$ is a neighborhood of $x$. (The intersection contains the smallest open ball between the open balls contained in $V$ and $W$.)
- For all $x \in X$ and for all neighborhood $V$ of $x$, it exists a neighborhood $W$ of $x$ such that $W \subset V$ and $W$ is a neighborhood of each of its points. (Consider the open ball $\mathcal{B}(x, \delta)$.)

**Distance to a set**
For a given point $x \in X$ and a given subset $Y \subset X$, $d(x, Y) = 0$ if and only if each neighborhood $V$ of $x$ contains a point of $Y$.

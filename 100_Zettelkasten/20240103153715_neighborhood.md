# Neighborhood

A neighborhood $V$ of a point $x \in X$ is a set of points in $X$ that contains $x$ where we can move some amount of that point (defined as an open ball) without leaving the set $V$.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $x \in X$. Let $V \subset X$. The set $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ if $\exists \delta > 0, \mathcal{B}(x, \delta) \subset V$. In particular, $\mathcal{B}(x, \delta)$ is a neighborhoood of $x$.
The collection of all neighborhoods of a point $x \in X$ is called a complete system of neighborhood and is denoted by $\mathfrak{N}_x$.

Open balls are neighborhoods of each of their points.

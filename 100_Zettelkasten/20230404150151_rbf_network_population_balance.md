# [[20230404150151_rbf_network_population_balance]] - Solving population balance equations using a radial basis function network
__Tags__: #population-balance #numerical-methods 

---
__Contents__: We aim to approximate the number density function (which is assumed to be continuous) using a radial basis function network. A RBF network is a linear combination of radial basis functions (e.g., Gaussian distributions). 
RBF is a numerical method and closed-form solutions can be derived. This can be used to simulate particles coagulation, optimize design of aerosol reactors or predict the performance of air pollution control devices.

_Examples_: Coagulation with different kernels.

**Question**:
* Could we use Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters of the RBF network?

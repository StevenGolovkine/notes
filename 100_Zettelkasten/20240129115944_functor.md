# Functors

A functor is a transformation from one category to another which preserves the structure of a category.

Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}^\prime$ be categories with objects $A$ and $A^\prime$respectively. A functor $F: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow C^\prime$ is a pair of functions $F_1: A \rightarrow A^\prime$ and $F_2: H(X, Y) \rightarrow H^\prime(F_1(X), F_1(Y))$, so that $F_2(1_X) = 1_{F_1(X)}$ and $F_2(gf) = F_2(g)F_2(f)$ for $f \in H(X, Y), g \in H(Y, Z)$.

The functor carries commutative diagrams into commutative diagrams.

Examples:
- The passage from a metric space $(X, d)$ to its associated topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is a functor from $\mathcal{C}_M$ to $\mathcal{C}_T$.

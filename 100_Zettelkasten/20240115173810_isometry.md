# Isometry

Two metric spaces $(A, d_A)$ and $(B, d_B)$ are isometric (or metrically equivalent) if there are inverse functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that
$$\forall x, y \in A, d_B(f(x), f(y)) = d_A(x, y) \quad\text{and}\quad \forall u, v \in B, d_A(f(u), f(v)) = d_B(u, v).$$
Note that the functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous.

A necessary and sufficient condition for these metric spaces to be isometric is that there exists a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ such that:
1. $f$ is one-one
2. $f$ is onto
3. $\forall x, y \in A, d_B(f(x), f(y)) = d_A(x, y)$.

Two metric spaces that are isometric are topologically equivalent ([[20240115181244_topological_equivalence]]).
The converse is false.
Example: The two metric spaces $(X, d_1)$ are $(X, d_2)$, where $X = (0, 1], d_1(x, y) = \lvert x - y \rvert$ and $d_2(x, y) = \lvert \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{y} \rvert$, are not metrically equivalent but are topologically equivalent. These spaces are not metrically equivalent because for all $x, y \in X, d_1(x, y) \leq 1$, while $d_2(x, y)$ may be greater than $1$. However, considering the function $f(x) = 1/x$, $(X, d_1)$ and $(X, d_2)$ are both metrically equivalent to $(Y, d_1)$ where $Y = [1, \infty)$, thus they are topologically equivalent.

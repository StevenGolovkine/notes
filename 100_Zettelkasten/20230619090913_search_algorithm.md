__Contents__:
In computer science, databases are treated as magical black boxes, names oracles. 

For example, if the database is sorted, the binary search is very efficient as the search space shrinks exponentially. The idea of binary search is that at each time, we compare the querying points to one in the middle of the database. 

But when the database is not sorted (unstructured), classical search algorithms are not efficient. Quantum algorithms are developed to to improve the search time (Grover's algorithm, [[20230619090809_grover_search_algorithm]]). Random search algorithms grow linearly with the number of inputs, while Grover's search algorithm with the square root of the number of inputs.

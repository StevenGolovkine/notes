# Between closure and interior

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space. Let $A$ be a subset of this topological space.
We have the following relationship between the closure and the interior of the set $A$:
$$C(\text{Int}(A)) = \overline{C(A)},$$
$$\text{Int}(A) = C(\overline{C(A)}) \quad\text{and}\quad C(\bar{A}) = \text{Int}(C(A)).$$

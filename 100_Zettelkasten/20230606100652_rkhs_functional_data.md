# [[20230606100652_rkhs_functional_data]] - RKHS in functional data
__Tags__: #functional-data #reproducing-kernel-hilbert-space  

---
__Contents__:
An Hilbert space $H$ is a RKHS where all the evaluation functional are bounded. Define a linear integral operator $L_K$ by
$$L_K(f) = \int_{\mathcal{T}} K(\cdot, s)f(s)ds$$
This is an extension of the covariance operator with covariance kernel to linear operator and Mercer kernel.

__Contents__: Product state is a multi-qubit state that can be written as the product of the qubits.
Example of such state is
$$|+0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00 \rangle + |10 \rangle \right).$$

The general form of a product state is, given $|a \rangle$ and $|b\rangle$,
$$|ab\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} b_0a_0 \\ b_0a_1 \\ b_1a_0 \\ b_1a_1\end{pmatrix}.$$
This is an extension of independant probabilities to amplitudes.

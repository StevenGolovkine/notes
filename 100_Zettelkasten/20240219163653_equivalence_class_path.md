# Equivalence class of a path

The equivalence class of a path $F$ is denoted $[\![F]\!]$.

An equivalence set of homotopic paths is called a homotopy class of paths. At a point $x$ in a topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$, the collection of homotopy classes of closed paths at $x$ is denoted by $\Pi(X, x)$.

Among these homotopy classes, there is the homotopy class $[\![e_x]\!]$, where $e_x$ is the constant path defined by $e_x(t) = x, 0 \leq t \leq 1$.

# [[20230503095408_entangled_state]] - Entangled state
__Tags__: #quantum 

---
__Contents__: This is a vector state that can not be written as a product of qubits. To create entanglement, we can apply a X-gate or Z-gate on a superposition of qubits.

Examples of entanglement usages:
* Simulation: it allows the usage of the $2^n$ amplitudes.
* Quantum communication: manipulation of qubits with quantum gates and for the transmissions.

Common entangled states:
$$|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00 \rangle + |11 \rangle \right)$$
$$|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00 \rangle - |11 \rangle \right)$$
$$|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|01 \rangle + |10 \rangle \right)$$
$$|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|01 \rangle + |10 \rangle \right)$$

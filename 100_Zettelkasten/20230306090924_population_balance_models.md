__Contents__: Population balance models are general models to track particle properties. For example, we may be interested by the distribution of the size of the particles and how it evolve through time. Models are derived from a general equation ([[20230306091422_equation_population_balance]]).

Five physical processes are analyzed using population balance models:
* Aggregation ([[20230306092016_aggregation]])
* Fragmentation ([[20230306092548_fragmentation]])
* Growth ([[20230306092604_growth]])
* Shrinkage ([[20230306092619_shrinkage]])
* Nucleation ([[20230306092640_nucleation]])

Some examples of population balance modeling:
* Crystallization
* Milling
* Drying
* Pneumatic conveyance
* Polymerization
* Fermentation
Population balance models have a lots of areas of applications, from agriculture engineering to transportation.

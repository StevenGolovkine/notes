# Fixed-point theorem

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and $(Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ be homeomorphic topological spaces. Then each continuous function $h: (X, \mathfrak{S}) \rightarrow (X, \mathfrak{S})$ possesses a fixed point if and only if each continuous function $g: (Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime) \rightarrow (Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ possesses a fixed point.

Brouwer fixed-point theorem: $I^n$ is the unit $n$-cube.
Let $f: I^n \rightarrow I^n$ be continuous.  Then there is a point $z \in I^n$ such that $f(z) = z$.

In particular, in dimension one, let $f: [0, 1] \rightarrow [0, 1]$ be continuous. Then, there is a $z \in [0, 1]$ such that $f(z) = z$. It is also the case for general interval $[a, b]$.

# Continuity

A function $f: (X, \mathfrak{S}) \rightarrow (Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ is said to be continuous at a point $x \in X$ if for each neighborhood $N$ of $f(x)$, $f^{(-1)}(N)$ is a neighborhood of $x$.
The function $f$ is continuous if $f$ is continuous at each point of $X$.

Property:
- The composition of two continuous functions is a continuous function.

**Continuity can also be characterized using open/closed sets ([[20240117173050_open_closed_sets]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if for each open subset $O$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(O)$ is an open subset of $X$.

A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if for each closed subset $O$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(O)$ is a closed subset of $X$.

Note that the continuity is characterized using the inverse image of open subsets and not that the image of open subsets. The image of open sets can be open, but the function still be not continuous.

**Continuity can also be characterized using closure ([[20240119115548_closure]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous if and only if for each subset $A$ of $X$, $f(\bar{A}) \subset \overline{f(A)}$.

**Continuity can also be chatacterized using subspaces ([[20240124174623_subspace_topological_space]]):**
A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is continous if and only if $f^\prime : X \rightarrow f(X)$ is continous, viewing $f(X)$ as a subspace of $Y$.

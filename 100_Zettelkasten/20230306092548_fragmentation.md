# [[20230306092548_fragmentation]] - Fragmentation

__Tags__: #fragmentation

__Contents__: The fragmentation of particles refers to the process of splitting one particle into two or more particles. This process is also named breakage. During this process, the number of particles increases while the total mass remains.
The fragmentation process can be written as a differential equation ([[20230306101549_breakage_equation]]).
Breakage can be undesirable (e.g. create dust) or desirable (e.g. grinding and milling).

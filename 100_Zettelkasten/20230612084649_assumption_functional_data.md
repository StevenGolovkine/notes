# [[20230612084649_assumption_functional_data]] - Assumptions in functional data
__Tags__: #functional-data 

---
__Contents__: We consider $N$ curves, and for $i = 1, \dots, N$, we observe $M_i$ sampling points for the $i$th curve.

We present here the common assumption in a functional data setting.

* Curves have $p + 1$ continuous derivatives (usually $p = 1$).
* We observe a certain number of points per curves:
$$\exists C > 0,~ \delta > 0 \mid \forall i = 1, \dots, N,~ M_i \geq C N^\delta.$$

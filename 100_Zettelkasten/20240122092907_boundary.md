# Boundary

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space. Let $A$ be a subset of this topological space.
The set of points that are arbitrarily close to both $A$ and $C(A)$ is called the boundary of $A$, denoted by $\text{Bdry}(A)$.

A point $x$ is said to be in the boundary of $A$ if $x$ is in both the closure of $A$ and the closure of the complement of $A$:
$$\text{Brdy}(A) = \bar{A} \cap \overline{C(A)}.$$
It results that $A$ and $C(A)$ habe the same boundary.

**Property:**
- The boundary of $A$ is closed.

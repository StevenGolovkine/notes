# Bounds

Let $A$ be a set of real numbers.

A number $b$ is called an upper bound of $A$ if $\forall x \in A, x \leq b$.
A number $c$ is called a lower bound of $A$ if $\forall x \in A, c \leq x$.
If $A$ has both an upper and lower bound, the set $A$ is said to be bouded.

A number $b^\star$ is called a least upper bound (l.u.b.) of $A$ if for each upper bound $b$ of $A$, $b^\star \leq b$.
A number $c^\star$ is called a greatest lower bound of $A$ if for each lower bound $c$ of $A$, $c \leq c^\star$.

Not every set of real numbers has an (least) upper bound or a (greatest) lower bound, but if it exists it must be arbitrarily close to that set.

Let $b$ be a g.l.b of the set $A$. 
- $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists x \in A / x - b < \epsilon$.
- $\exists a_1, a_2, \dots \in \mathbb{R} / \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, a_n \in A, \lim_n a_n = b$.

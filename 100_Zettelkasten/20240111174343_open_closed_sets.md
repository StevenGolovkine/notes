# Open and closed sets

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $Y$ a subset of $X$.

Definition: $Y$ is open if $Y$ is a neighborhood of each its points.
Characterization: $Y$ is open if and only if it is a union of open balls.

**Some properties:** Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.
- The empty set is open.
- $X$ is open.
- If $O_1, \dots, O_n$ are opens, then $O_1 \cap \dots \cap O_n$ is open.
- If for each $\alpha \in I$, $O_\alpha$ is open, then $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} O_\alpha$ is open.

Definition: $Y$ is closed if its complement $\bar{Y}$ is open.

Note: A set can be both open and closed or neither open nor closed.

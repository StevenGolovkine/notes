# Open and closed sets

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $Y$ a subset of $X$.

Definition: $Y$ is open if $Y$ is a neighborhood of each its points.
Characterization: $Y$ is open if and only if it is a union of open balls.

Definition: $Y$ is closed if its complement $\bar{Y}$ is open.
Characterization: 
- $Y$ is closed if and only if $Y$ contains all its limit points.
- $Y$ is closed if and only if for each sequence of points $a_1, a_2, \dots$ of $Y$ that converges to a point $a \in X$, $a \in Y$.
- $Y$ is closed if and only if $\forall x \in X$, $d(x, F) = 0 \Rightarrow x \in F$. 

Note: A set can be both open and closed or neither open nor closed.

**Some properties:** Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.
- The empty set is open and closed.
- $X$ is open and closed.
- The intersection of a finite collection of open sets is open. The intersection of a family of closed sets is closed.
- The union of a family of open sets is open. The union of a finite collection of closed sets is closed.

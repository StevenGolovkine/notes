# Open balls

The open ball of a point $x \in X$ is the set of points that have a distance from $x$ less than $\delta$, and is denoted by $\mathcal{B}(x, \delta)$.

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Let $x \in X$ and $\delta > 0$ be given. The open ball about $x$ of radius $\delta$ is
$$\mathcal{B}(x, \delta) = \{y \in X, d(x, y) < \delta\} \subset X.$$

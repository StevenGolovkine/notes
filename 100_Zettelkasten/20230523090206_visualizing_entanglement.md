# [[20230523090206_visualizing_entanglement]] - Visualizing entanglement
__Tags__: #quantum #entanglement

__Contents__:
Applying different gate to the vector states will impact them differently:
* H-gate: reverse the role of x-meas and z-meas (swap the axes).
* X-gate: change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

For one qubit, an horizontal line will refer to x-meas probability, while a vertical line will refer to z-meas probabilty.

For two qubits

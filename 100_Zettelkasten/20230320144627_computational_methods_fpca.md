__Contents__: Diverse computational methods can be found to estimated the FPCA.
* By discretizing the functions. The integral is then estimated using numerical approximation (e.g. trapezoidal rule, Gaussian quadrature schemes).
* By using a basis function expansion of the functions. In that case, we have to be careful to include the inner-product matrix between the basis functions. A special case arrive if the observations are its own basis function, resulting to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix.

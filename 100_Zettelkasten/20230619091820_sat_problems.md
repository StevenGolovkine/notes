__Contents__: A SAT problem is a problem whose goal is to find a string of bits according to certain constraints. It is a kind of problem where it is easy to check if a proposed solution is correct. To improve the performance, we can convert an algorithm that checks solutions into a quantum circuit that changes the phase of solution states (Grover's algorithm, [[20230619090809_grover_search_algorithm]]).

The search space grows exponentially with the number of bits ($N = 2^n$). We can use the Sch√∂ning's algortihm to improve the performance using the structure of the problem and its combinaison with the Grover's algorithm should lead to quicker results.

# [[20230320135503_bayes_theorem]] - Bayes theorem
__Tags__: #bayesian-analysis

__Contents__: Given a vector of observations $Y = (Y_1, \cdots, Y_n)^\top$ and a vector of parameters $\theta = (\theta_1, \cdots, \theta_p)^\top$. We aim to estimate the distribution of the vector of parameters.
The Bayes theorem is given by
$$\mathbb{P}(\theta | Y) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(\theta)\mathbb{P}(Y | \theta)}{\mathbb{P}(Y)},$$
where 
* $\mathbb{P}(\theta | Y)$ is the distribution _a posteriori_ of the parameter vectors and our quantity of interest.
* $\mathbb{P}(\theta)$ is the distribution _a priori_ of the parameter vectors. It corresponds to our knowledge of the parameters set.
* $\mathbb{P}(Y | \theta)$ is the likelihood of the observed data.
* $\mathbb{P}(Y)$ is the distribution of the observation, used as a normalization term.

This can be estimated by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm ([[20230320140913_metropolis_hastings]]).

# Open and closed sets

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space.

**Characterization using neighborhood**:
 - A subset $O$ of $X$ is an open set if and only if $O$ is a neighborhood of each of its points.

- A subset $F$ of $X$ is a closed set if and only if $C(F)$, the complement of $F$, is an open set.

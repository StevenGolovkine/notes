# Connectedness and continuous mappings

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and $(Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ be topological spaces. Let $f: (X, \mathfrak{S}) \rightarrow (Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ be continuous of $X$ onto $Y$.

If $A$ is a connected subset of $X$, then $f(A)$ is a connected subset of $Y$.
If $X$ is connected, then $Y$ is connected.
Assume that $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and $(Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ are homeomorphic ([[20240123174349_homeomorphism]]), then $X$ is connected if and only if $Y$ is connected.

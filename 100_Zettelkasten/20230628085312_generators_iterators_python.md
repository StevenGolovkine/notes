__Tags__: #python #software-engineering

__Contents__: Iterators can be created using generators that yield a stream of data. Generators creates function-based iterators, usually simpler than class-based iterators.

Generator expressions are list comprehension with rounded bracked. We can create efficient data pipeline with generator iterators by passing iterators to functions.

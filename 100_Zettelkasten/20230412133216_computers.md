__Contents__: A computer can be reduced as a very simple machine. The most simple form of a computer consists of three blocks.

The first block is input parameters.
The middle block is the algorithm.
The third block is output (results of the algorithm).

Computers use bits to perform computation. First, bits were stored as punched cards where a hole correponds to $1$ and no hole corresponds to $0$. Then, compact disks appears. A ray scans the CD and if the surface is flat, the bit is at state $0$, if it mets a transition between flat surfaces, the bit is at state $1$. Now, the idea of quantum computing is to store bits as electron orbitals. The activated shells (orbits of an electron) will refer to the state of the bits.

# Intermediate-Value theorem

Let $f: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous and let $f(a) \neq f(b)$. Then for each number $d$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there is a point $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f(c) = d$.

Special case of $d = 0$:
If $f(a)f(b) < 0$, then there is an $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f(c) = 0$.

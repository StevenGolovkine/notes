# Between topological and neighborhood spaces

Suppose a topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and use the neighborhoods of this space to create a neighborhood space $(X, \mathfrak{N})$. Then, use the open sets of $(X, \mathfrak{N})$ to create a new topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$. 
In that case, we have $\mathfrak{S} = \mathfrak{S}^\prime$.

Suppose a neighborhood space $(X, \mathfrak{N})$ and use the open sets of this space to create a topological space $(X, \mathfrak{S})$. Then, use the neighborhoods of $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ to create a new neighborhood space $(X, \mathfrak{N}^\prime)$.
In that case, we have $\mathfrak{N} = \mathfrak{N}^\prime$.

There is a one-one correspondance between the collection of all topological spaces and the collection of all neighborhood spaces.

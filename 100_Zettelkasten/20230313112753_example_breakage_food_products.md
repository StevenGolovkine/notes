__Contents__: During conveying, particles can break (especially for granular or friable particles).
Two breakage mechanisms exist:
* Erosion: one particle results in one particle plus a number of smaller fine particles.
* Fracture: one particle into multiple particles of same size (cleavage) or multiple particles of different size (shattering).
The representing size of each interval (bin) is the center of each interval. The breakage frequency can be estimated by minimizing the error between predicted and experimental mean size in time.

**Questions**:
* Could we make a continuous model?

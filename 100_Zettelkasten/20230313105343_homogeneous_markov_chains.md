# [[20230313105343_homogeneous_markov_chains]] - Homegeneous Markov Chains
__Tags__: #markov-chains

__Contents__:  Homogeneous Markov chains are Markov chains (in the sense that it respects the Markovian property) with the assumption that the transition probabilities are independent of time.

Note $\tau$ a transition step, $a(t)$, the vector of probabilities to be in each state at time $t$, and $p$, the transition matrix. The probabilities to be in each state after $m \tau$ steps is
$$a(t + m\tau) = a(t)p^m.$$

# Connectedness

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ and $(Y, \mathfrak{S}^\prime)$ be topological spaces. Let $A$ be a subspace of $(X, \mathfrak{S})$. A subspace $A$ of $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is connected if it is all of one piece, i.e., if it is impossible to decompose the subspace into two-disjoint non-empty open sets.

Definition: $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is said to be connected if the only two subsets of $X$ that are simultaneously open and closed are $X$ and $\emptyset$.
A subset $A$ of $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is said to be connected if the only two subsets of $A$ that are simultaneously relatively open and relatively closed in $A$ are $A$ and $\emptyset$.

**Characterization using continuous mappings:**
Let $Y = \{0, 1\}$. $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is connected if and only if the only continuous mappings $f: X \rightarrow Y$ are the contant mappings.

A topological space which is not connected is said to be disconnected.
**Characterization:**
- $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is disconnected if and only if there are two non-empty open (or closed) subsets $P$ and $Q$ such that $P \cup Q = X$ and $P \cap Q = \emptyset$.
- $A$ is disconnected if and only if there exist two open (closed) subsets $P$ and $Q$ of $X$ such $A \subset P \cup Q$, $P \cap Q \subset C(A)$, and $P \cap A \neq \emptyset$, $Q \cap A \neq \emptyset$.

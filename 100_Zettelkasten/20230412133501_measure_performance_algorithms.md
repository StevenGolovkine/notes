# [[20230412133501_measure_performance_algorithms]] - Measure performance of algorithm
__Tags__: #algorithm-theory

__Contents__: To measure the performance of an algorithm, we are interested by how the ressources (time or space), an algorithm use, grow with the size of the input. It is also referred as the complexity of the algorithm.

Different complexity:
* Constant time: does not depend on the size of the input.
* Linear time: grows proportionally with the size of the input.
* Exponential time: grows proportionally as $10^{size}$ of the input.
This measure ignores computer specific characteristics.

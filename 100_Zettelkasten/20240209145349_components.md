# Components

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space. For each point $a \in X$, there is a non-empty subset $\text{Cmp}(a)$, called the component of $a$, with the property that $\text{Cmp}(a)$ is connected and if $D$ is any connected subset of $X$ containing $a$, then $D \subset \text{Cmp}(a)$.

**Properties**:
- Let $b \in \text{Cmp}(a)$, then $\text{Cmp}(b) = \text{Cmp}(a)$.
- The components consitute a partition of $X$ ([[20240209151019_partition]]).
- Each component is a closed set.
- If $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ is a locally connected ([[20240209153048_locally_connected]]) topological space and let $Q$ be a component. Then $Q$ is an open set.

__Contents__: The usage of non-extensive statistical models for the size distribution of particles undergoes multiple breakage process over time. It is based on a generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and accounts for long-range correlations between all parts of a fragmented object. The approach combines a non-extensive entropy with a kinematic equation with a fractional index for the time evolutionof the parameters of the fragments. Experimental data are needed to test the validity of the model.

# Limit points

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $Y$ a subset of $X$.
A point $x \in X$ is a limit point of $Y$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point of $Y$ different from $x$.

The point $x$ is the limit of a convergent sequence of points of $Y$. But the limit of a convergent sequence of points of $Y$ is not always a limit point.

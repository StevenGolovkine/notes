__Contents__: A class of coagulation weight transfer functions that lead to a stochastic particle algorithm for the numerical treatment of population balance equation is presented. It is based on systems of weighted computational particles (number of computational particles does not change during coagulation events). Stochastic weighted particle methods are numerical techniques for solving population balance equations. It represents the population of particles as a set of (weighted) computational particles. It allows for the simulation of processes involving large numbers of particles. It has good conservation and convergence properties.

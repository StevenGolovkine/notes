__Contents__: Quantum physics explain behaviors that physicist never seen before. Computer scientists exploit quantum physics to create more efficient algorithms, e.g. integer factorization. 

Key experiments:
* The ultraviolet catastrophe (concerns black holes)
* The double-split experiment (sending particles through holes)

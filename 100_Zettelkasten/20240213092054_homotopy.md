# Homotopy

Let $(X, \mathfrak{S})$ be a topological space.
Let $F_0$ and $F_1$ be two paths in $X$ with the same initial point $p_0 = F_0(0) = F_1(0)$ and the same terminal point $p_1 = F_0(1) = F_1(1)$. $F_0$ is said to be homotopic to $F_1$ if there is a continuous function $H(x, t): I^2 \rightarrow X$ such that:
- $H(0, t) = p_0, 0 \leq t \leq 1$,
- $H(1, t) = p_1, 0 \leq t \leq 1$,
- $H(x, 0) = F_0(x), 0 \leq x \leq 1$,
- $H(x, 1) = F_1(x), 0 \leq x \leq 1$.
The function $H$ is called a homotopy connecting $F_0$ and $F_1$. In this event, we say that the path $F_0$ is deformable into the path $F_1$ with fixed end points.

**Properties**: Let $F_0, F_1, F_2$ be three paths with the same initial point and the same terminal point.
- $F_0$ is homotopic to itself.
- If $F_0$ is homotopic to $F_1$, then $F_1$ is homotopic to $F_0$.
- If $F_0$ is homotopic to $F_1$ and $F_1$ homotopic to $F_2$, then $F_0$ is homotopic to $F_2$.

**Example:**
Consider an annulus ([[20240210113527_annulus]]). This annulus is path-connected (see Figure 1).

We may think of the two paths $F_0$ and $F_1$ as elastic strings that rely the points $p_0$ and $p_1$. Given a unit of time, we may smoothly deform the path $F_0$ into the path $F_1$ (see Figure 2).

The paths can be defined on the homographic image $I_0$ (resp. $I_1$) of the unit interval, where $I_0$ (resp. $I_1$) is set of points $(x, 0)$ (resp. $(x, 1)$). This allows us to defined the function $H$ by setting $H(x, t) = F_t(x, t)$ (see Figure 3).

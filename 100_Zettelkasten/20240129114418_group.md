# Groups

A group $(G, \times)$ is a set $G$ together with a function which associates to each ordered pair $(g_1, g_2)$ of elements of $G$, an element $g_1 \times g_2 \in G$ such that:
- $g_1 \times (g_2 \times g_3) = (g_1 \times g_2) \times g_3$ for $g_1, g_2, g_3 \in G$.
- There is an element $e \in G$, called the identity, such that for all $g \in G, e \times g = g \times e = g$.
- For each $g \in G$, there is an element $g^{-1} \in G$ called the inverse of $g$, such that $g \times g^{-1} = g^{-1} \times g = e$.

# Product of sets

The *Cartesian product* of two sets is denoted by $A \times B$ and is defined by
$$A \times B = \{(x, y) \,/\, x \in A \;\text{and}\; y \in B \}.$$

The *direct product* of a sequence of sets is denoted by $\prod_{i = 1}^n A_i$ and is defined by
$$\prod_{i = 1}^n A_i = \{(x_i)_{i = 1, \dots, n} \,/\, \forall i = 1 \dots n, x_i \in A_i\}.$$
As an example, the set of points of Euclidean $n$-space is given by $\mathbb{R}^n$ and is the direct product of $\mathbb{R}$ spaces.

The *infinite direct product* of a sequence of sets is denoted by $\prod_{i = 1}^\infty A_i$ and is defined by
$$\prod_{i = 1}^\infty A_i = \{(x_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \,/\, \forall i \in \mathbb{N}, x_i \in A_i\}.$$

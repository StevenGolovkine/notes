__Contents__: Functional Principal Components Analysis is used to characterized the key features within the curves. It gives a particular view of the covariance structure of the data. and looks for a linear combinations of the data that respect some constraints.
The eigenequation is given by:
$$\Gamma \phi = \lambda\phi \Longleftrightarrow \int \Gamma(s, t)\phi(s)\mathrm{d}s = \lambda\phi(t),\quad \forall t,$$
where 
* $\Gamma$ is the covariance operator.
* $\phi$ is a particular eigenfunction.
* $\lambda$ is a particular eigenvalue.

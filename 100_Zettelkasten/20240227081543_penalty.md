# Penalty

Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
We define the operator $\Delta$ as first-order differences: $\Delta\alpha_j = \alpha_j - \alpha_{j -1}$. The $d$th order differences are defined by applying the operator $d$ times.
$\Delta^d \alpha_j$ does not exist for $j < d + 1$. If $\alpha$ has $n$ elements, $\Delta^d \alpha$ has $n - d$ elements. This can be represented as matrix multiplication. This matrix $D_d$ is obtained in R and Python as
```r
D_d = diff(diag(n), diff=d)
```
```python
D_d = np.diff(np.eye(n), n=d, axis=0)
```

To measure the roughness of $\alpha$, we use the sum of the squares of differences of order $d$: $R = \lvert\!\lvert D_d \alpha \rvert\!\rvert^2$ or $r = \sqrt{R / (n -d)}$.

New approach to model shoot attempts and compare players

# Summary and contributions

The article proposes a statistical model to analyze the shooting habits of different players in basketball. The zero-inflated Poisson model with clustered regression coefficients aims to capture both the frequency and heterogeneity of field goal attempts across the court.
The proposed method is validated through simulation studies, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical justification. The authors apply this model to National Basketball Association (NBA) data from the 2017-2018 regular season to learn players' shooting habits and heterogeneity among different players.
This approach provides insights into various aspects of shooting habits in basketball, which can be useful for professional players, coaches, and team managers seeking to improve their understanding of the game.

They model the count directly using a Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson regression approach.

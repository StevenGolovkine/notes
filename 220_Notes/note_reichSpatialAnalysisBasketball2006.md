Example of shooting analysis

# Summary and contributions

The query discusses how basketball coaches use shot charts to analyze shot locations and outcomes. Shot charts are simple plots of each shot taken during a game, showing the location and result.

The query suggests that instead of just using shot chart data descriptively, teams could improve their defense by making inferences about players' tendencies and abilities based on this data. To achieve this, the query proposes hierarchical spatial models for shot-chart data, which allow for spatially varying effects of covariates.

In simpler terms, these models enable coaches to analyze how factors like distance from the basket and angle from the centerline affect a player's shooting patterns. The query illustrates this approach using Sam Cassell's 2003-2004 shot chart data as an example.

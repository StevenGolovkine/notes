# Summary and contributions

The article proposes a Bayesian joint model for marked spatial point processes, where the intensity is incorporated in the mark model as a covariate. This approach allows for the analysis of the association between the mark (success rate) and intensity (shot location) of basketball shots.
Inferences are performed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and two Bayesian model comparison criteria are used to assess the model. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.
The article applies this approach to the shot charts of four NBA players (Curry, Harden, Durant, and James) in the 2017-2018 regular season, analyzing their shot intensity and field goal percentage in detail. Additionally, the analysis is extended to the top 50 most frequent shooters in the season, revealing a positive association between field goal percentage and shot intensity for most players.
This study provides valuable insights for coaches, analysts, fans, statisticians, and players themselves to better understand the factors influencing shot success rates in professional basketball.

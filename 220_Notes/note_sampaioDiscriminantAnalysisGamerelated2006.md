# Title of the paper
Discriminant analysis of game-related statistics between basketball guards, forwards and centres in three professional leagues

# Learning goal (why read this?)
Concern players poistion

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Study the game-related statistics between players' position

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
Players from NBA, ACB and LCB

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach on players' position

# Summary and contributions

The query examines differences in game-related statistics between basketball guards, forwards, and centres playing in three professional leagues (NBA, ACB, and LCB). The goal is to identify patterns that can help coaches establish and monitor playing patterns, as well as improve player recruitment and training programs. The analysis uses discriminant functions to identify statistics that maximize mean differences between playing positions. The results show that players' game-related statistics vary according to their position, with emphasis on different tasks such as defensive/ offensive rebounds, assists, blocks, and 3-point field-goals.

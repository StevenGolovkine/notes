# Title of the paper
Analysis of Professional Basketball Field Goal Attempts via a Bayesian Matrix Clustering Approach

# Learning goal (why read this?)
Work on a similar project than mine

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Clustering of shot charts

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
2017-2018 NBA season

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach to clustering shooting patterns with a probabilistic interpretation

# Summary and contributions

The query proposes a Bayesian nonparametric matrix clustering approach to analyze the latent heterogeneity structure in shot selection data from professional basketball players in the NBA.
The method uses a mixture of finite mixtures framework and incorporates spatial information via a mixture of matrix normal distribution representation. The query suggests an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling, which allows simultaneous inference on both the number of clusters and cluster configurations.
The query also establishes large-sample convergence properties for the posterior distribution. The empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to shot chart data from selected players in the NBA's 2017-2018 regular season.

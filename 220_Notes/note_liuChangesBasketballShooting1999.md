# Title of the paper
Changes in Basketball Shooting Patterns as a Function of Distance

# Learning goal (why read this?)
One of the first paper to analyze shooting patterns as a movement

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Model shot accuracy with respect to distance

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
10 adults without basketball experience

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach to model shooting patterns

# Summary and contributions

The study examined how distance affects accuracy and movement form in basketball shooting. Five male and five female participants with no significant experience shot the ball 20 times each from eight different distances (5-40 ft.). They also pretended to shoot the ball 5 times at each distance, making a total of 200 shots each. The results showed that:

1. As distance increased, accuracy decreased.
2. The movement patterns changed significantly as distance increased, with participants shifting between different patterns 86% of the time.

The study found some differences in when these transitions occurred depending on whether participants were actually shooting or just pretending to shoot. Overall, it suggests that basketball shooting can be thought of as a dynamic system where movement patterns change abruptly at certain distances.

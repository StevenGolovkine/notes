# Title of the paper

$k$-means algorithms for functional data

# Learning goal (why read this?)

Understand the $k$-means algorithm for functional data and its relationship with RHKS

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)

Perform a taxonomy of curves working explicitly in the infinite-dimensional space

# Data and domain (with what and where?)

Data: sampled (multidimensional) functional data

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)

Generalisation of the $k$-means algorithm to functional data

# Summary and contributions

They consider the observations as a point in a general function space and project these points onto a RKHS using Tikhonov regularization theory.
Clustering methods based on kernels:
* Methods based on kernelization of the distance
* Clustering in feature space
* Methods based on SVM
Important contribution: interpretation of two-stage clustering methods based on fPCA.
Define two distances in RHKS based on different projections of the observations and effective dimension reduction strategies for them.

# Summary and contributions

The query discusses how analytics has been transforming the game of basketball by providing insights that inform team strategy, player management, and personnel decisions. The review focuses on methods for quantifying and characterizing basketball gameplay at both the team and individual levels.

At the team level, the query explores ways to characterize team strategy and performance. At the player level, it delves into various tools for evaluating players, including metrics for overall value, defensive ability, shot modeling, and understanding production curves over multiple seasons.

The query concludes by highlighting the importance of causal inference in sports analytics, suggesting that future research should focus on establishing cause-and-effect relationships between variables to make more informed decisions.

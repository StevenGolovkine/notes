# Title of the paper

On Mahalanobis distance in functional settings

# Learning goal (why read this?)

Understand how the Mahalanobis distance in used in functional data analysis

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)

Consider the extension of the Mahalanobis distance to functional data

# Data and domain (with what and where?)

Not applicable here, theory-based paper

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)

Generalisation of the Mahalanobis distance to functional data (real functions defined on a compact interval of the real line) using RHKS.

# Summary and contributions

Difficult to extend to functional because of the non-invertibility of the covariance operator.

The distance is defined as the distance between the observations (curves) projected in the RHKS controlling the roughness of the approximation.

Properties of the proposed distance:
* True metric as opposite as usual semi-metric for Mahalanobis-type distance
* Invariant under isometries
* Consistenly estimated from the data + convergence rates under some mild conditions
* Known sampling distribution under Gaussian models

Proposed applications:
- Outliers detection
- Binary classification

# Title of the paper

Derivative principal component analysis for representing the time dynamics of longitudinal and functional data

# Learning goal (why read this?)

Understand the estimation of the derivatives of functional data using functional principal components.

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)

Model the derivatives of smooth underlying trajectories.

# Data and domain (with what and where?)

Data: longitudinal functional data (biomedical studies)

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)

Specilisation of the functional principal components analysis to the derivatives.

# Summary and contributions

* Represent (directly) derivatives as an expansions into eigenfunctions of derivative process.
* The estimation is performed using a spectral-decomposition of the covariance function of the derivative trajectories.
* Derive convergence rates for the derivatives of the mean, covariance and eigenfunctions.

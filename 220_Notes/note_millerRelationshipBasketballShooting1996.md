# Summary and contributions

The study used 3D cinematography (100 Hz) to investigate the relationship between distance and shooting kinematics in basketball, with respect to playing position. Fifteen participants were divided into guards, forwards, and centers (n=5 each), and performed jump shots from three distances: 2.74, 4.57, and 6.40 meters from the basket.

The results showed that:

1. As shooting distance increased, mean release speed also increased for all groups.
2. This was due to increased angular velocities of shoulder flexion and elbow extension, as well as an increase in center-of-mass speed towards the basket.
3. Release angles at shorter distances (52-55°) provided a steep angle of entry into the basket, while those at the longest distance (48-50°) required minimum release speed.
4. All groups exhibited earlier release timing with increasing shooting distance, resulting in an earlier shoulder axis rotation.

The study found that guards showed more consistent changes in kinematic patterns with changing shooting distances compared to centers, suggesting that adjusting for long-range shots may be easier for guards who regularly shoot from a distance.

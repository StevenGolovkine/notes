# Title of the paper

Common functional principal components

# Learning goal (why read this?)

Understand how to incoroporate information from two samples in the common FC

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)

Propose common principal components for two-samples problem

# Data and domain (with what and where?)

Functional data. 
Application to the dynamic of implied volatility

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)

Generalisation of the two-samples problem to functional data.

# Summary and contributions

Propose to test how far two function distributions are.
The estimation of the eigencomponents is based using the Gram matrix.
The purpose of two samples inferences is two compare each elements of the eigendecomposition. The considered statistics are the squared norm of the difference between the elements of the two samples.
Most of the paper is theoretical results, asymptotic converge of the tests.

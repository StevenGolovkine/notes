# Summary and contributions

The article highlights the transformative power of data visualization in sports, particularly in basketball. The rise of shot maps has changed the game by providing a visual representation of where "good" or "bad" shots are taken from. This has led to professional teams taking shots from different positions on the court than they did 20 years ago.
However, current shot maps have limitations, such as insufficient interactivity and inability to compare differences across situations. To address these limitations, the authors designed HoopInSight, an interactive visualization system that enhances the capabilities of shot maps in basketball analytics.
The system features a novel spatial comparison visual technique, which allows for the comparison of two different scenarios. The article also discusses design considerations, scalability, and transferability of this approach, as well as the benefits and pitfalls of designing as domain experts.

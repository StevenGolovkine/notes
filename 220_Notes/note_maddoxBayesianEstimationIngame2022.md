# Title of the paper
Bayesian estimation of in-game home team win probability for college basketball

# Learning goal (why read this?)
Utilisation of Bayesian model for game prediction.

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Estimate in-game probability for NBA games

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
40000 NCAA basketball games

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach to estimation of in-game probability

# Summary and contributions

The new query discusses two Bayesian methods for estimating and predicting home team win probabilities in NCAA men's college basketball. The first method uses a prior that adjusts based on the lead differential and time elapsed, while the second method is an adjusted version of the first, combining the Bayesian estimator with a time-weighted pregame win probability.

The query compares these new methods to existing ones, showing that they are either competitive or outperforming existing methods for both estimation and prediction. The utility of the proposed methods is illustrated through an application to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball seasons from 2012/2013 to 2019/2020.

# Title of the paper

Fault detection of batch processes based on multivariate functional kernel principal component analysis

# Learning goal (why read this?)

I would like to do kernel MFPCA.

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)

They propose kernel MFPCA with an applications.

# Data and domain (with what and where?)

Multivariate functional data with an application to process monitoring.

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)

Extension of kernel PCA to multivariate functional data.

# Summary and contributions

- Propose kernel MFPCA.
- Expand curves into a basis of functions with a roughness penalty (the basis can be different for each feature).
- The curves are scaled.
- Compute link between covariance and Gram matrix.
- Introduce kernel trick for MFD with a basis decomposition.

Applications:
- Control charts
- Monitoring procedures

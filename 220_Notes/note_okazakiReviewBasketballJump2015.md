The study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature on basketball free throws and jump shots to identify the critical components of successful shooting. The results are presented in three sections:

3. Additional variables that influence shooting

The study aimed to provide insights for coaches, teachers, and players on what to focus on when teaching, learning, practicing, and performing a jump shot.

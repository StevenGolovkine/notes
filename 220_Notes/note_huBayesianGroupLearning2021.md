# Title of the paper
Bayesian group learning for shot selection of professional basketball players

# Learning goal (why read this?)
To understand the heterogeneity of shot selection

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Create groups of shot charts

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
Players than have made more than $400$ field goal attempts in the 2017-2018 season.

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach to define groups in shot charts and comparison between players.

# Summary and contributions

The article proposes a group learning approach to analyze the heterogeneity structure of shot selection among professional basketball players in the NBA. The mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) model is used to capture the heterogeneity of shot selection among different players based on the Log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP).
This method can simultaneously estimate the number of groups and group configurations, providing insights into the underlying patterns of shot selection. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for this proposed model.
Simulation studies demonstrate its performance, and the approach is further illustrated by analyzing shot charts of selected players in the NBA's 2017-2018 regular season.
This analysis can provide valuable information for coaches, analysts, fans, statisticians, and even players themselves to gain a deeper understanding of shot selection patterns in professional basketball.

# Summary and contributions

The article analyzes the effects of defensive pressure on shooting performance in basketball. The study examined 3344 shooting attempts from winners and losers teams using statistical tests such as Wilcoxon signed ranks tests, Friedman tests, and odds ratio calculations.
The results showed significant differences between winning and losing teams for close-range 2-point and 3-point shooting percentages. The increased level of defensive pressure (defined as the distance between the shooter and the defender) had a significant influence on shooting performance and game outcome.
The study concluded that winning teams achieved higher shooting percentages due to better team cooperation, allowing players to create more scoring opportunities without facing active defensive pressure. Additionally, winners were able to force their opponents into trying shots under maximum defensive pressure, leading to higher shooting percentages.
The most significant difference between winning and losing teams was the ability of winners to effectively exploit scoring opportunities, both without defensive opposition and under high-level defensive pressure.

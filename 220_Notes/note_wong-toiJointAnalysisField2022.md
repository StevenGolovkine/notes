# Title of the paper
A Joint Analysis for Field Goal Attempts and Percentages of Professional Basketball Players: Bayesian Nonparametric Resource

# Learning goal (why read this?)
Work on a similar problem than mine (clustering shooting patterns)

# Task or problem (what are they solving?)
Understanding shooting patterns with clustering using Bayesian nonparametric model considering player-level variability

# Data and domain (with what and where?)
2018-2019 NBA regular seasons

# Context and relationship (new approach, specialisation of, generalisation of, application of, survey of, example of, ...)
New approach to the analysis of shooting patterns.

# Summary and contributions

The query discusses understanding shooting patterns among different basketball players, which is a fundamental problem in game analysis. The paper proposes a joint Bayesian nonparametric mixture model to identify latent clusters of players based on their shooting patterns.
The study applies this model to analyze the shooting patterns of selected NBA players over two seasons: 2018-2019 regular season and 2019-2020 bubble season. The results reveal 13 clusters in the first season and 7 clusters in the second season.
The query examines the shooting patterns of players within these clusters, exploring their relation to other available information. The findings provide new insights on the effect of the NBA COVID bubble and may offer useful guidance for player shot selection and team strategy planning.

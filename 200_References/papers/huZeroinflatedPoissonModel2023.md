>Although basketball is a dynamic process sport, played between two sides of five players each, learning some static information is essential for professional players, coaches, and team managers. In order to have a deep understanding of field goal attempts among different players, we propose a zero-inflated Poisson model with clustered regression coefficients to learn the shooting habits of different players over the court and the heterogeneity among them. Specifically, the zero-inflated model captures a large portion of the court with zero field goal attempts, and the mixture of finite mixtures model captures the heterogeneity among different players based on clustered regression coefficients and inflated probabilities. Both theoretical and empirical justification through simulation studies validate our proposed method. We apply our proposed model to data from the National Basketball Association (NBA), for learning players' shooting habits and heterogeneity among different players over the 2017–2018 regular season. This illustrates our model as a way of providing insights from different aspects.

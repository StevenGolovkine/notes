>[!Abstract]
>
>This book is based on the authorâ€™s experience with calculations involving polynomial splines, presenting those parts of the theory especially useful in calculations and stressing the representation of splines as weighted sums of B-splines. The B-spline theory is developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This reprint includes redrawn figures, and most formal statements are accompanied by proofs.

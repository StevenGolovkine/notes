>[!Abstract]
>
>Population balance modeling is undergoing phenomenal growth in its applications, and this growth is accompanied by multifarious reviews. This review aims to fortify the model's fundamental base, as well as point to a variety of new applications, including modeling of crystal morphology, cell growth and differentiation, gene regulatory processes, and transfer of drug resistance. This is accomplished by presenting the many faces of population balance equations that arise in the foregoing applications.

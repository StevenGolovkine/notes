>In this paper, we focus on the partial functional linear model with missing observation, which allows the responses or part of the covariates or responses and part of the covariates simultaneously missing at random, where the regression error is a linear process deduced by not necessarily independent random variables. Under the reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting, we construct the estimators of the slope parameter and coefficient function in the model based on the inverse probability weighting methods, and establish their asymptotic normality and weak convergence with rates, respectively. Meanwhile, the penalized estimator of the parameter is defined by the SCAD penalty and its oracle property is investigated. In addition, we construct a test statistic to check a linear hypothesis of the nonzero parameters and discuss its asymptotic distribution. Simulation study and real data analysis are conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.

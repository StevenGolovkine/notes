# Second order stationary linear equation

Study of the equation:
$$D^2x = -\beta_0 x - \beta_1 Dx, \quad\text{or}\quad L = D^2 + \beta_1 D + \beta_0 I$$
When $\beta_1 = 0$ and $\beta_0$ is positive, this is the *harmonic* equation with $\beta_0 = (2\pi \omega)^2$. The solution space of the harmonic equation is: $x(t) = C_1e^{z_1t} + C_2e^{z_2t}$ where $z_1, z_2$ are solutions of $z^2 + \beta_1z + \beta_0 = 0$.
